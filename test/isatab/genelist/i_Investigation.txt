Study Identifier	"ARMSTRONG-S-1"
Study Title	"MLL-AF9 fusion transformation progenitor to leukemia stem cell"
Study Submission Date	"07/04/2010"
Study Public Release Date	"06/08/2006"
Study Description	"Leukaemias and other cancers possess a rare population of cells capable of the limitless self-renewal necessary for cancer initiation and maintenance.  Here we show that leukaemia stem cells (LSC) can maintain the global identity of the progenitor from which they arose while activating a limited stem-cell- or self-renewal-associated programme. We isolated LSC from leukaemias initiated in committed granulocyte macrophage progenitors through introduction of the MLL–AF9 fusion protein encoded by the t(9;11)(p22;q23). The LSC were capable of transferring leukaemia to secondary recipient mice when only four cells were transferred, and possessed an immunophenotype and global gene expression proﬁle very similar to that of normal granulocyte macrophage progenitors. However, a subset of genes highly expressed in normal haematopoietic stem cells was re-activated in LSC. LSC can thus be generated from committed progenitors without widespread reprogramming of gene expression, and a leukaemia self-renewal-associated signature is activated in the process. Our ﬁndings deﬁne progression 
from normal progenitor to cancer stem cell, and suggest that 
targeting a self-renewal programme expressed in an abnormal context may be possible. "
